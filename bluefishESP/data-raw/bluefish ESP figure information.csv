1,Background,bluefish migration,Conceptual model of bluefish seasonal migrations.,"A map of the east coast United States and Northwest Atlantic Ocean. Bluefish seasonal migrations are outlined on the map. Spring bluefish groups are located in the northern (Delaware to Massachusetts) and southern (North Carolina to Maryland) Mid Atlantic Bight. Bluefish in the northern MAB in the late spring to late fall overwinter in Florida if they were less than 45cm in length and overwinter offshore in the MAB if they were over 45cm in length. Bluefish in the southern MAB consist of both transients and residents. Bluefish found in southern Florida are mostly less than 45cm and have the highest abundance in winter. Spawning occurs in the Southern Atlantic Bight in the spring, in the MAB in the summer, and possibly in Florida in the fall and winter."
